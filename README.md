## Overview

You're an independent developer or part of a lean team. You want reliable unit tests for your new React-Recoil app, but you need to move fast and time is major constraint. More importantly, you want your tests to reflect how your users interact with the app, rather than testing implementation details.

Enter [Chromogen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromogen). Chromogen is a Jest unit-test generation tool for Recoil selectors. It captures state changes during user interaction and auto-generates corresponding test suites. Simply launch your app after following the installation instructions below, interact as a user normally would, and with one click you'll download a ready-to-run Jest test file.

### Don't have a Recoil app handy?
Chromogen's [official demo app](https://github.com/michellebholland/recoil-demo-todo) provides a ready-to-run Recoil frontend with a number of different selector implementations to test against.

### Chromogen is in active Beta
Chromogen currently supports three main types of test:
  1. **Initial selector value** on page load
  2. **Selector derived value** for a give state, using state snapshots captured after each Transaction.
  3. **Selector _set_ logic** for a given starting state and `newValue` argument.

These test suites will be captured for _synchronous, pre-composed_ selectors only. However, the presence of asyncronous and/or dynamically-created selectors in your app should not cause any issues with the captured tests. Chromogen can identify such selectors at run-time and exclude them from capture.

**Note:** Chromogen uses selector keys to populate the import & hook statements in the test file. If your source code does _not_ match variable names to keys, you will need to manually update the import statement and useStoreHook to match your actual variable names. The actual test variables are pre-generated in the useStoreHook and so will be unaffected. (Although test names may be long and meaningless if your app implements UUID keys.) We are currently working on an update that will allow Chromogen to grab variable names from source code instead of relying on keys.

In addition to the smart-import mentioned above, the following features are also in active development:
  1. selectorFamily testing
  1. DevTool panel to move download & stop/start buttons out of the rendered app
  1. Testing transaction updates in series, rather than as discrete states

At this time, we have no plans to introduce tests for async selectors; the mocking requirements are too opaque and fragile. However, we are always open to suggestions to meet the needs of our userbase. Want to see this or any other feature added to the package? [Let us know!](#contributing)

## Installation

Before running Chromogen, you'll need to make two changes to your application:
  1. Import the `<ChromogenObserver />` component as a child of `<RecoilRoot />`
  1. Import all atoms and selectors from Chromogen instead of Recoil

These changes do have a small performance cost, so they should be reverted before deploying to production.

### Download the Chromogen package from npm.

```
npm install chromogen
```

### Import the ChromogenObserver component
ChromogenObserver should be included as a direct child of RecoilRoot. It does not need to wrap any of your other components, and it takes no props. It utilizes Recoil's TransactionObserver hook to record snapshots on state change.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { RecoilRoot } from 'recoil';
import { ChromogenObserver } from 'chromogen';
import MyComponent from './components/MyComponent.jsx';

const App = (props) => (
    <RecoilRoot>
      <ChromogenObserver />
      <MyComponent {...props} />
    </RecoilRoot>
)

export default App;
```

### Import atom & selector functions from Chromogen
Wherever you import `atom` and/or `selector` from Recoil (typically in your `store` file), import them from Chromogen instead. The arguments passed in do **not** need to change in any away, and the return value will still be a normal RecoilAtom or RecoilSelector.  Chromogen wraps the native Recoil functions to track which pieces of Recoil state have been created, as well as when various selectors are running and what values they return.

```js
import { atom, selector } from 'chromogen';

export const fooState = atom({
  key: 'fooState',
  default: {},
});

export const barState = selector({
  key: 'barState',
  get: ({ get }) => {
    const derivedState = get(fooState);
    return derivedState.baz || 'value does not exist';
  }
})
```

## Usage
After following the installation steps above, launch your app as you normally would. You should see two small dots in the top left corner.

![Buttons](./assets/screenshots/README-buttons.png)

The green button, on the left, is the **Download** button. Clicking it will download a new test file that includes _all_ tests generated since the app was last launched or refreshed.

The red button, on the right, is the **recording toggle**. Clicking it will pause recording, so that no tests are generated during subsequent state changes. Red indicates "recording in progress" and yellow means the recording is paused. Pausing is useful for setting up a complex initial state with repetitive actions, where you don't want to test every step of the process.

_For example,_ if we want to test our Todo app's filter and sort buttons, we may want to have 10 or so different items with various priority levels and completion states. However, we don't necessarily want 10 separate tests just for adding items. We can instead add one or two items to generate tests for that functionality, then pause recording while we add the other 8 items. Once everything is added, we can resume recording to generate filter & sort tests with all 10 items present.

<hr />

Once you've recorded all the interactions you want to test, click the green button to download the test file. Then just drag-and-drop the downloaded file into your app's test directory.

![Download](./assets/screenshots/README-download.png) ![File](./assets/screenshots/README-file.png)

Before running the test file, you'll need to specify the import path for your store by replacing `<ADD STORE FILEPATH>`. The default output assumes that all atoms and selectors are imported from a single path; if that's not possible, you'll need to separately import each set of atoms and/or selectors from their appropriate path.

### BEFORE:
![Filepath](./assets/screenshots/README-filepath.png)

### AFTER:
![Filepath Updated](./assets/screenshots/README-filepath-updated.png)

You're now ready to run your tests! Upon running your normal Jest test command, you should see three suites for `chromogen.test.js`:

![Test Output](./assets/screenshots/README-test-output.png)

**Initial Render** tests whether each selector returns the correct value at launch. There is one test per selector.

**Selectors** tests the return value of various selectors for a given state. Each test represents the app state after a transaction has occured, generally triggered by some user interaction. For each selector that ran after that transaction, the test asserts on the selector's return value for the given state.

**Setters** tests the state that results from setting a writeable selector with a given value and starting state. There is one test per set call, asserting on each atom's value in the resulting state.
